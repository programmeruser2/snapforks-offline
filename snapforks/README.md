#
A complete rewrite of SnapCups. More simple to use! And the Code is less complex.

Open and issue or pull request! It would help SnapForks!

## Notes
When you publish a Snap! project, SnapForks may not find the project, wait at least a day or two to pass by then test it. If it does not work open a new issue titled "Publish Error" and in the description write the project author and name..
